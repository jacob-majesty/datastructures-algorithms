# Book Summary

I- Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin

- Meaningful names to avoid confusion and have a self-documenting code
- Functions should do only one thing 
- Consider Comments as an apology (The code must be self explanatory)
- Code error handling (Function should either handle an error or execute logic, but not both. This approach increases clarity and ensures a function adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle)
- Functions without side effects (Pure function: They should not modify any states or values outside their own scope)


II- Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler
